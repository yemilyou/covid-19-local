# COVID-19 Local Confirmed Cases & Fatalities Prediction

## Overview
This exercise aims to predict the spread of COVID-19 in California with limited data (based on only dates and number of cases/fatalities). 
The objective is to project the number of infections/deaths to better understand where we are headed in combating the pandemic and assist with policy decisions.

## Data Source
The data is based on numbers from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE):
